# machine-learning-programming exercise
Programming exercises from Coursera's Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.
## Welcome
Welcome to my ML assignments! Thanks to the detailed [assignment documents](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/) and [TA's tutorials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/all/threads/m0ZdvjSrEeWddiIAC9pDDA), I completed all codes by myself.

Warning: solutions for reference but not Plagiarism.

Any comments and suggestions are welcomed!
